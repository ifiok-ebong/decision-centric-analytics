# Decision Statement (Draft) — Rivalytics Retention Budget Allocation

## Decision (one sentence)
Prioritize **mid-tenure retention (4–12 months)** over onboarding improvements for the next quarter because it protects **more revenue at risk** while churn concentration is roughly split between early and mid.

## Decision-critical evidence (only)
- **Churn concentration:** Early 46.6% vs Mid 44.0% (near-tie).
- **Revenue at risk (MRR, prev month):** Early 798,415 vs Mid 1,407,419 → **Mid**.
- **Usage decay prior to churn (median):** Early -37.2% vs Mid -11.1% (early shows sharper decline; interpret as activation failure signal).
- **Support burden:** % churned accts with any tickets (last 3 months) — Early 11.0% vs Mid 37.4% (mid higher incidence).

## Decision rule applied
Per the pre-analysis plan, **revenue at risk is primary**. When churn concentration is split, prioritize the cohort where a constrained intervention protects more recurring revenue.

## Explicit assumptions (must hold)
- MRR in the month prior to churn is a reasonable directional proxy for “revenue at risk” for cohort comparison.
- Tenure cohort at churn month is a meaningful proxy for lifecycle stage.
- Directional differences are sufficient for this quarter’s one-choice decision.

## What would change the decision
- If a revised revenue-at-risk definition (e.g., next-3-months MRR) flips the cohort ranking.
- If churn concentration shifts materially (e.g., early becomes the clear majority of churn events).
