# Two-minute decision script (Step 9)

We have one quarter and one budget to reduce churn, so we must pick **one** lever: fix onboarding (0–3 months) or protect mid-tenure customers (4–12 months).

We used only four decision-critical metrics, cohorted by tenure at churn.

1) **Churn concentration:** churn is split - early is 46.6% of churn events vs mid 44.0%, so churn volume alone does not force a choice.

2) **Revenue at risk (primary):** mid-tenure carries materially more revenue at risk under multiple definitions. Using MRR in the month prior to churn, early is 798,415 vs mid 1,407,419. Stress testing revenue timing (prior month, 3‑month average, churn month) does not flip the result.

3) **Usage decay:** early shows a sharper pre-churn usage drop (activation failure signal), but that does not outweigh the revenue-at-risk difference.

4) **Support burden:** a higher share of mid-tenure churners had support tickets pre-churn (37.4% vs 11.0%), suggesting retention work can address high-friction accounts with revenue at stake.

**Decision:** prioritize mid-tenure retention this quarter. Revisit if a different revenue-at-risk definition reverses the cohort ranking or if churn concentration shifts materially toward early tenure.
