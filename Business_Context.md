# Business Context Summary

## Industry
B2B Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

---

## Business Model
- Subscription-based recurring revenue
- Tiered pricing plans (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- Optional feature add-ons billed monthly

---

## Customer Profile

---

## Current Situation
Customer acquisition is stable and predictable. However, leadership has observed:

- A gradual increase in churn over the past 12 months
- Slowing net revenue growth due to retention pressure
- Increasing internal debate over where intervention efforts should focus

---

## Strategic Tension
Two internal narratives are competing:

- **Growth** believes churn is primarily driven by poor early activation
- **Customer Success** believes churn is driven by declining value among established customers

Both narratives are plausible.  
Both teams can point to supporting metrics.  
Resources do not allow both to be addressed simultaneously.

## Why This Matters
Retention interventions are expensive and path-dependent.

Choosing the wrong focus:
- Wastes budget
- Delays impact
- Reinforces organizational misalignment

Analytics is expected to reduce uncertainty and support a clear, defensible trade-off.
