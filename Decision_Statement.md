## Decision to Be Made
Allocate limited improvement budget for the next quarter toward **one** of the following:

1. **Onboarding and early-stage activation improvements**, or  
2. **Retention incentives and enhanced support for mid-tenure customers**

---

## Constraints
- Budget allows only one initiative to be meaningfully funded
- Implementation window is one quarter
- Engineering and operations capacity is fixed
- Partial funding of both options is not viable

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Onboarding Improvements
- Improve early activation
- Reduce churn within the first 90 days
- Decrease time-to-value for new customers

### Option B: Mid-Tenure Retention
- Offer targeted retention incentives
- Improve customer support experience
- Reduce churn among established customers

---

## What Would Change the Decision
The decision would change if evidence shows:

- Churn is disproportionately concentrated in one tenure segment
- Revenue-at-risk is materially higher in one segment
- Usage decay precedes churn more strongly in one segment
- Intervention leverage differs meaningfully between segments

---

## Decision Success Criteria
The decision is considered successful if it:

- Targets the customer segment with the highest marginal impact on churn reduction
- Protects the greatest amount of at-risk recurring revenue
- Can be justified without requiring additional data collection
