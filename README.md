# Decision-Centric Analytics

A decision-first analytics case study designed to demonstrate **decision architecture** and analytical restraint.

## Purpose
This project exists to demonstrate how analytics should be designed to support real, constrained business decisions — not to showcase dashboards, tools, or technical sophistication.

**Core question:** How does analytics fail when dashboards are built without an explicit decision, and how does decision clarity change what data, metrics, and visuals are required?

## Outputs
- Written case study using the locked project template
- Clearly stated decision
- Before/after comparison of analytics framing
- Decision-aligned artifact
- Distilled, generalizable insights

## Status
- Dataset: not included yet (to be added later)
